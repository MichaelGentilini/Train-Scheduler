# Train-Scheduler-
train schedule application that incorporates momement.js for time conversion and Firebase to store arrival and departure data

Users enter the train's name, destination, time of the first train, and frequency.  With some calculations, the next arrival

New things learned and used

- Use Firebase Database to store data
- Use Moment.js to easily convert
- Also used awesome-fonts, an icon, and found a js clock that displays the current time in the jumbotron
